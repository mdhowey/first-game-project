This game is based rigidly on the Tomagotchi game made popular in the 90s.
Having been the proud owner of many of these fun, egg-shaped creatures, 
I decided to make make it pretty spot on with the original. The main
difference is the game speed. The entire game lasts about 30 seconds
from naming the penguin to the end of its life.
